**College Enquiry Chatbot**

**Overview of the Project**

A simple rule-based AI chatbot that answers college-related queries using Natural Language Processing (NLP).  
Built with **Python** and **Streamlit**, it can respond to questions about admissions, fees, facilities, and more.

**List of Technologies Used**
 #Python 3 
 #NLTK - Web UI framework 
 #Streamlit - Natural Language Processing 
 #Regular Expressions (Regex) - Pattern matching for intent recognition.

**Features**

 1. Understands common student queries  
 2. Provides instant responses  
 3. Simple and interactive UI  
 4. Extendable with more questions or ML models

**Steps to run it locally**

1. Clone this repository:
   Use bash:-
     git clone https://github.com/manishd416/College-Enquiry-Chatbox.git
2. Installation required
   Create a virtual environment(optional but recommended), then run:
     pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Run the Chatbot using:
     streamlit run college_chatbot.py

**Future Enhancement**
As this is my first project, I have used only a small database of my college. You can edit the database as you wish.
1. Add speech-to-text and voice replies
2. Replace rule-based logic with a trained Intent Classification ML Model.
3. Deploy online using Stramlit Cloud.
4. Add NPU-optimized inference using ONNX Runtime. But use with care(may not be stable).
